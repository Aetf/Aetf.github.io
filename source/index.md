Congratuations! You have made it to the Unlimited Code Works! Welcome!

Here, I'd like to share some exciting projects I'm currently working on or have worked
on in the past, as well as all kinds of interesting ideas I have, be it silly or not ;).
This also serves as a way of maintaining an archive. Feel absolutely free to get in
touch with me if you find anything interesting!

Some words about myself now. My name is Peifeng Yu (Aetf is my nickname) and I'm
currently working towards a Master's degree in Computer Science. I’ve dabbled with
compiler and system architecture, opensource projects and japanese animes
(Yes, animes (ﾉ>ω<)ﾉ).

I love reading stories. Be it animes, comics or games, it is the stories in them that
fascinate me most. As for favorate game types? AVG, RPG, detective games and sometimes
music games. Basically I love all games with a great story. I even tried to figure out
the story behind [Fate/Unlimited Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate/unlimited_codes),
a arcade fighting game :P.

Anyway, hope my articles could help you or at least bring you some fun. Live long and
prosper...and el psy congroo!
