Some words about myself now. My name is Peifeng Yu (Aetf is my nickname) and I'm
a PhD student at the University of Michigan,
working with Professor [Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://www.mosharaf.com).
While doing research in system and networking, I mostly dabble in GPU and 
infrastructure for deep learning systems.

Aside from academia, I spend most of my time in opensource [projects](/projects) and ACG.
I love reading stories. Be it animes, comics or games, it is the stories in them that
fascinate me most. As for favorate game types? AVG, JRPG, detective games and sometimes
music games. Basically I love all games with a great story. I even tried to figure out
the story behind [Fate/Unlimited Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate/unlimited_codes),
a arcade fighting game :P.

Anyway, hope my blog could help you or at least bring you some fun. Live long and
prosper ðŸ––
