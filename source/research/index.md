Most of my research happens in _improving computer system infrastructure for deep learning applications_.
This ranges from GPU sharing primitives to facilitate better scheduling and improve
resource utilization, to better hyperparameter tuning execution engine providing better utilization
in the cluster. Currently, I'm working on new inference servering frameworks with better support for
dynamic neural networks.

For a complete list of my past experience, please refer to my [CV](/assets/dl/cv.pdf) (last updated: Sep. 2021).
