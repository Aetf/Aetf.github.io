Most of my research happens in _improving computer system infrastructure for deep learning applications_. More
specifically, I'm currently working on making GPU more flexible in terms of sharing to facilitate better
scheduling and improve resource utilization.
For a complete list of my past experience, please refer to my [CV](/assets/dl/cv.pdf) (last updated: Sep. 2019).

The following is a list containing all my publications, plus posters.
