## Favorite part

GSoC means lots of code work. That's my favorite part. From time to time, I just feel like writing code, for something useful. And GSoC gives me this opportunity, plus the additional benefit to contribute to the opensource.

While I submitted a few patches to some projects, I was never deeply involved in any related communities. With GSoC, which forces you to interact with others in the community and get involved more. In this way it improves my understanding of the project .

It's also interesting to participate in a large project and learn about how people actually develop and manage a big code base. You have to be in the workflow to see how it is different from what you learnt from book. That's a valuable experience for my study and my work.

## Most challenging part

Communicating with others seems to be the most challenging part. As a non-native English speaker, it takes time to be familiar with and accustomed to various conventions used in communication, like mailing list, IRC and review boards. And I have to double check every time to make sure I'm using appropriate words and being polite. However, this is also a great practice for me to learn English. After all, you can only learn a language by using it.
